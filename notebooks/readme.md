Certainly! To analyze the impact of economic indicators on exchange rates, you can use Python to perform statistical analysis and time series forecasting. Below is a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to load the data, calculate the surprise factor, and perform a simple time series forecast using the ARIMA model.

```import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
from datetime import datetime

# Load your spreadsheet data into a DataFrame
# Replace 'your_spreadsheet.csv' with the actual file path
df = pd.read_csv('your_spreadsheet.csv')

# Convert the date format from YYYYMMDD to a datetime object
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='%Y%m%d')

# Calculate the surprise factor as the difference between release value and market expectation
df['Surprise'] = df['Release_Value'] - df['Market_Expectation']

# Assume 'Exchange_Rate' is a column in your DataFrame
# Fit an ARIMA model to forecast the exchange rate
# You may need to adjust the order (p,d,q) based on your data
model = ARIMA(df['Exchange_Rate'], order=(5,1,0))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast the next period (adjust 'steps' for your desired forecast length)
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=5)  # For example, 5 days ahead

# Print the forecasted values
print(forecast)

# Optionally, plot the original data and the forecast
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Exchange_Rate'], label='Original')
plt.plot(pd.date_range(start=df['Date'].iloc[-1], periods=5, freq='D'), forecast, label='Forecast', color='red')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Exchange Rate')
plt.title('Exchange Rate Forecast')
plt.legend()
plt.show()```

Before running this code, make sure you have the required libraries installed:

pip install pandas statsmodels matplotlib

This code snippet does the following:
•  Loads the macroeconomic data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

•  Converts the date column to a datetime object for easier manipulation.

•  Calculates the surprise factor as the difference between the actual release value and the market expectation.

•  Fits an ARIMA model to the exchange rate data to forecast future values.

Please note that ARIMA models require stationary time series data, so you might need to perform additional data preprocessing such as differencing or transformation to achieve stationarity. The order of the ARIMA model (p, d, q) should be determined based on the characteristics of your data, possibly using grid search or AIC/BIC criteria.

Remember to replace 'your_spreadsheet.csv', 'Release_Value', 'Market_Expectation', and 'Exchange_Rate' with the actual column names from your spreadsheet. Adjust the steps parameter in the forecast method to match the time period you want to forecast.
